By default, Open Payments interactions centre around an [account](./accounts)
resource and all APIs are relative to the account URL.

The account URL is [discovered](./discovery) through a
[Payment Pointer](./terminology#payment-pointer) which is an account identifer
for Interledger-enabled accounts.

Said differently, any account identified by a Payment Pointer can be paid into
using the [STREAM](terminology#STREAM) protocol.

This feature allows clients to setup payments, for uses cases such
[web monetization](./web-monetization), with a single API call, to get the
payment details, and be guaranteed that the receiving account supports ILP as
payment method.

A **PayID** is an alternative identifier which, unlike Payment Pointers that
identify accounts, identifies [account owners](./terminology#account-owner).

The
[PayID URI specification](https://github.com/xpring-eng/rfcs/blob/master/payid/dist/spec/payid-uri.txt)
defines the format of a PayID to be `acctpart "$" host`.

With respect to Open Payments the `acctpart` is the account owner identifier and
`host` is the origin of the Open Payments server.

The following PayID identifies an account for the owner `alice` at the wallet
`wallet.example`:

> `alice$wallet.example`

## Open Payments PayID Discovery

As with all APIs in Open Payments the [owner](./owner.mdx) is a resource and is
identified by a URL.

The
[PayID URI specification](https://github.com/xpring-eng/rfcs/blob/master/payid/dist/spec/payid-uri.txt)
allows for any protocol to define a discovery protocol on top of the identifier.
For Open Payments the discovery protocol is as follows:

1. Given a PayID conforming to the prescribed format, `acctpart "$" host`,
   extract the values **acctpart** and **host**.
2. Let **path** be the string `/$/` concatenated with **acctpart**
3. Let **account owner URL** be a new URL as defined in
   [WHATWG URL](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-url) where:
   1. The URL's scheme is `https`
   2. The URL's host is **host**
   3. The URL's path is **path**

For example, the PayID `alice$wallet.example` resolves to the URL
`https://wallet.example/$/alice`.

The `/$/` path prefix minimizes the chance that Web servers will have path
conflicts with their existing services.

## Privacy

Open Payments servers that support PayIDs SHOULD put mitigations in place to
prevent clients "farming" data about the account owners that have accounts on
the server.

## API

Having resolved the owner API endpoint URL a client can use the owner API to
discover the accounts available to it and setup a new transaction.

See the [owners API](./owners) for more details.
